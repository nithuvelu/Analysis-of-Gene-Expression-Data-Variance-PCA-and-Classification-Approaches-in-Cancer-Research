### **Question 1.a:**
**Compute the variance, covariance, and correlation matrix of your random subset of 10 genes.**
- Add an appropriate table to your report.

---

### **Question 1.b:**
**Using R, calculate the distance matrix of your random subset of 10 genes.**
- Add an appropriate table to your report.

---

### **Question 1.c:**
**Using R, calculate univariate Q-Q plots and a Q-Q plot based on the generalized distance for the observations of your random subset of 10 genes.**
- Add appropriate figures to your report.

---

### **Question 2:**
**Use R for a principal component analysis (PCA) of your random subset of 10 genes.**
- Add appropriate tables and figures to your report.

---

### **Question 3.a:**
**Fit a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) model to your random subset of 10 genes.**

- Add appropriate tables and figures to your report.

---

### **Question 4.a:**
**Apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to your random subset of 10 genes and the class variable (invasive (label 1) and noninvasive (label 2) cancer).**
- Calculate a confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification error.
- Add appropriate tables and figures to your report.

---

### **Question 4.b:**
**Apply Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) to your random subset of 10 genes and the class variable (invasive (label 1) and noninvasive (label 2) cancer).**
- Calculate a confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification error.
- Add appropriate tables and figures to your report.

---

### **Question 4.c:**
**Discuss the difference between LDA and QDA using the results on your random subset of 10 genes and the class variable (invasive (label 1) and noninvasive (label 2) cancer).**

---

### **Question 5:**
**Use the median of the first principal component of your random subset of 10 genes to predict the class variable (invasive (label 1) and noninvasive (label 2) cancer).**
- Use Fisherâ€™s Exact test and calculate sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden index.
- Add appropriate tables and figures to your report.
